## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Prettier
- Stylelint

### What I learned

I used the new nested CSS specifications for the first time in this project! It wasn't too much of a jump for me, since I've used SASS before. This was super convenient.

### Continued development

I want to continue to focus on responsive design, hopefully with finding more efficient ways to fluidly size things.
